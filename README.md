## Experience

### ENIGMATIX PVT LTD.
**Backend Developer** *(Mar 2022 – Present)*  

Currently at Enigmatix, I focus on designing and developing scalable backend systems using Python, Django, and Django REST Framework (DRF). I also work with FastAPI, and Flask to build microservices and explore modern, service-oriented backend architectures, ensuring high performance, maintainability, and scalability.

**Key Responsibilities:**
- Designed and developed RESTful APIs with DRF, implementing authentication, pagination, filtering, and custom permissions.
- Built backend systems for platforms involving user interactions, content management, product handling, and transactions.
- Developed APIs using Flask, Flask-RESTX, and FastAPI, structuring scalable microservices, handling request parsing, error responses, API documentation, and applying asynchronous programming patterns.
- Worked with NestJS to apply modular service-based architectures in Node.js.
- Conducted API testing with Postman to ensure proper functionality and error handling.
- Collaborated with frontend and mobile developers to integrate APIs and ensure real-time data flow.
- Managed relational and non-relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB), including schema design, query optimization, indexing, and migrations.
- Experienced in ticket and project management systems including Jira, ClickUp, Trello, and GitLab, for sprint tracking, issue management, and team collaboration.
- Followed Agile practices, participating in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and collaborative coding.
- Used Git for version control and GitLab for repository management, CI/CD pipelines, and team collaboration.
