- Built backend systems for platforms involving user interactions, content management, product handling, and transactions.
- Developed APIs using Flask, Flask-RESTX, and FastAPI, structuring scalable microservices, handling request parsing, error responses, API documentation, and applying asynchronous programming patterns.
- Worked with NestJS to apply modular service-based architectures in Node.js.
- Conducted API testing with Postman to ensure proper functionality and error handling.
- Collaborated with frontend and mobile developers to integrate APIs and ensure real-time data flow.
- Managed PostgreSQL and MySQL databases, including schema design, query optimization, and migrations.
- Followed Agile practices, participating in daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and collaborative coding.
